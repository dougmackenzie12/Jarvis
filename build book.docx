Jarvis Build Book




2016 04 22 – Working towards getting Jasper framework installed from source on Raspberry Pi B.

http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation


Loaded Raspbian OS
I loaded the standard Raspbian ISO, and used the “Raspberry Pi Configuration” program to setup the Pi. I had to use a static IP to get it onto the network. I used 192.168.1.3/24 as the address.


Followed Method 3 from: http://jasperproject.github.io/documentation/installation

Failed at:
sudo pip install -r jasper/client/requirements.txt

The above command failed, needing the yaml.h file.

Changed to:

sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools
sudo apt-get install libyaml-dev
sudo pip install -r jasper/client/requirements.txt


Installing Pocket sphinx

sudo apt-get install pocketsphinx
sudo apt-get install subversion autoconf libtool automake gfortran g++ --yes

Got down to:  “Then, when you’ve left the CMUCLTK directory, download the following libraries:”
